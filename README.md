# Bar Chart: Population of the Top 10 Most Populous Countries (2024)

📊 Task-01 | Prodigy Infotech Internship




# Objective

-- To develop a bar chart visualization that effectively presents the population distribution among the top 10 most populous countries in 2024. The goal is to provide a clear, visual comparison of global population figures using Python and data visualization libraries.


# Project Overview

-- This project uses manually created sample data to illustrate population sizes (in millions) for each country. The bar chart is enhanced with:

-- Distinct colors for each country bar

-- Exact population values displayed above the bars

-- Labeled axes and a meaningful title

-- Grid lines for visual clarity

-- This visualization makes it easy to interpret and compare the population of different countries at a glance.

# Countries Included

-- India

-- China

-- United States

-- Indonesia

-- Pakistan

-- Nigeria

-- Brazil

-- Bangladesh

-- Russia

-- Mexico



# Tools & Technologies Used

-- Python – Core programming language

-- Matplotlib – Visualization library used to generate the bar chart




# Output Description

The output consists of a color-coded bar chart where:

-- The X-axis lists the countries

-- The Y-axis represents population in millions

-- Each bar is labeled with its population value

-- Visual enhancements include:

-- Customized color scheme

-- Grid lines for better readability

-- Rotated X-axis labels for spacing and clarity



💡 Additional Notes

-- The dataset is hardcoded; no external file (CSV or Excel) is required.

-- The project runs seamlessly on Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

-- This task introduces fundamental skills in data visualization using Python.
